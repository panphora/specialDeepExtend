get the type of the target data

if array

  loop through children of target data

    for each child, find match in source data using the id

      if source data found

        fill missing keys in the target data using the source data
        call this function recursively on the child and matching child

if object

  for each key/value pair in target data

    if value is an object or array in BOTH the source AND target data

      call this function recursively on these children
  
  for each key/value pair in source data

    if key is missing from target data, fill it in with value from source
